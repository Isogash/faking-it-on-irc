## Installation ##

To get the IRC bot up and running simply navigate to this repository's root folder and run `npm install`. If everything goes smooth you can then run `node irc.js` to start the bot. Keep in mind to configure the bot's settings in *config/irc.json* beforehand. The HTTP server side of this project will come soon.
